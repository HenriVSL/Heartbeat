# Heartbeat
Heartbeat is designed to be simple and minimal tool to show heart rate.
Simple design goals were to not use GPS and work well without touchscreen so it can be used while swimming or in sauna. Fast refresh rate and reasonable battery life were also neat features.

## How to use
Simply open the app on your watch and wait until heart rate is displayed.

On first startup it is needed to give permission for sensors and then restarting the app.

To exit the app hold button number 1. On Suunto 7 it is the top right button. After that the app asks if you want to exit.

## Features
Implemented:
* Heart rate reading after startup without messing with UI.
* Recording of MIN MAX values
* No touchscreen needed to use the app basic features.
* Minimal theme. Using 14 segment font called "DSEG" by keshikan. Licensed under SIL OFL

Planned:
* log the heart rate for the session. Somehow to browse the logged values.
* Make a graph of the logged values
* Comment the code better
* Play Store release for free so people don't need to mess with APK or Android Studio.
